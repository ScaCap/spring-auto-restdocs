=== Section snippet

The section snippet combines all snippets in this REST Docs extensions and also includes unmodified snippets from Spring REST Docs.
It helps you being even more lazy, because a single line of AsciiDoc is sufficient to document one endpoint.
Assuming of course that you already documented your code with JavaDoc.

The aim of this [Spring REST Docs](https://projects.spring.io/spring-restdocs/)
extension is to help you write even less - both code and documentation.
You still get the same nice documentation as with Spring REST Docs itself.
The main benefit is that writing less and moving the documentation closer
to the code increases the maintainability of the documentation.

In Spring REST Docs you have to add the documentation for your JSON with
a DSL in your test. We moved this documentation to the POJO that represents
your JSON object. You just add Javadoc to the fields and it will end
up in the documentation.

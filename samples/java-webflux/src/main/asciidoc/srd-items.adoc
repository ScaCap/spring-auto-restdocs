=== Get an item (SARD/SRD mix)

This part of the documentation demonstrates the combination of Spring Auto REST Docs with Spring REST Docs:
The path parameter and response field are manually documented with Spring REST Docs.
The authorization is still coming from Spring Auto REST Docs and
the cURL and HTTP response are coming from Spring REST Docs in any case.
